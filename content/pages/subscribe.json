Many of these thoughts have been cultivated through home-education, memories, experiences, and sometimes random notes on my phone when something interesting popped in my head.\n\n#### [Subscribe here](https://dev.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=a38ee5cfd956e8a3181e097a9&id=34ae01c4a6 \"Mailchimp\") to receive an email when I (sporadically) post new articles."
