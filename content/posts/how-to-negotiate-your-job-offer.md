The art of negotiating your compensation level for a new job can be a very tricky thing to master. People usually like to avoid confrontation, and in return, end up working for much less money than they are worth. 

One of the biggest mistakes I see people make in NYC is they are all obsessed with their base-salary number. While I would agree (not to be hypocritical) that base-salary is important, they are several other factors that need to be factored in as well. Often times, people rarely even think to bring these extra forms of compensation up.

Here's what I'm talking about:

1. Yearly Bonus: A large bonus (even though it will most-likely be taxed pretty heavy) can help you reach a yearly compensation number if your base-salary is lower than desired.
2. Profit-Sharing: This is less-common in today's age, but you will still see some companies that give out additional monies to their employees if the firm has a particularly strong quarter / year. Worth asking about.
3. Free Food at the Office: Kinda gimmicky but worth more in big cities where food us very expensive (NYC lunch prices are fraudulent imo).  For someone spending almost $15 a meal on lunch, an extra $300/month isn't something to overlook.
4. Stock / Stock Options: Deferred comp is sometimes tough to grasp because many factors usually have to happen before a payout (company needs to be sold above a strike price, 'x' number of years to vest, etc.) but the lucky ones out there that have been able to take advantage of these are very wealthy. I found a good article helping people out with stock options that is worth reading, I won't get deep enough here to. be useful.
5. 401K match: Free money from your company. You should almost always contribute at least the amount to receive your full company match on 401k or Roth 401k. A big 401k match from your company could help put you in a nice position for retirement down the road.
6. Company-specific benefits: Make sure you thoroughly review the complete benefits package before accepting the offer. Some employers will try to withhold this until you have accepted but what lies within could make or break your decision.
7. Know when it expires: Don't always assume that your offer expires in a few days. Some leading tech firms will keep offers available for up to a year, so you don't have to miss out on an upcoming bonus or just to give you ample time to consider the switch.

Some of the above info I learned from Cracking the Code Interview, which has an amazing section on how to negotiate once you receive an offer. Definitely worth reading, even if you are in a discipline outside of technology. They go much deeper on how to approach these conversation s and statistics behind people that counter and those who don't (spoiler: the people that counter end up much wealthier on average).
