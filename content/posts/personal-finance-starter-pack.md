_"Is there anything I am missing out on right now?"_

I get this question a lot from friends and family members. Originally, I was going to use this as a re-write for my original article where I detail my favorite services and share my referral links (**shameless**). On second thought, I decided to do that here and also  give my take on what a good personal finance _stack_ might look like more generically.

We'll start with covering all of the ways we usually spend money (in no particular order):

1. Rent / Bills
2. Food / Living Essentials
3. Travel
4. Clothes
5. Miscellaneous unnecessary but desired items

And after all of these we hope there is some money left over. This is where people start to get overwhelmed at the amount of choices to come next:

1. Short-term savings (emergency fund, leftover money after bills, etc).
2. Short-term Investments
3. Long-term investments

In the past few years, dozens of services have become available to help you try to max out what you can get for "free" (usually at the cost of your data or the chance you'll carry debt). My take (and yes this is just an opinion) is you basically need the following areas covered to have a healthy portfolio:

1. Credit card(s) with benefits tailoring your highest-spending categories.
2. A cash-back app for online and in-store products.
3. An exchange to buy stocks without broker fees.
4. A place where you could buy and store cryptocurrencies, more-so to be prepared for what may arise in adoption over the next decade.
5. A place to get up-to-date financial information (this one is usually overlooked but could be equally as important) on topics like these:
   1. world markets / interest rates / conversion rates
   2. online and in-store shopping deals
   3. bank account and credit card bonuses 
6. A way to monitor your credit score and credit activity.
7. A high-yield checking or savings account for on-hand funds (basically just to avoid inflation).
8. An app to split expenses with friends and family members (no need to bring complicated receipt math into the next decade).

I have an app, website, or service covering all of the above items and can vouch it has made me more confident in my financial decision-making. It has also helped pad my wallet a little bit over the last few years.
