## New Year New Site

I've recently been working as a senior web developer for a men's clothier in Manhattan, NY. Now that I have sharpened my web-dev skills, I realized how out-of-date and lackluster my personal website has become. I've had Gatsby on my list of things to learn for awhile now, and have heard it's ideal for static pages and blogs. I bit the bullet, found a gatsby starter i wanted to build off of, and finally said goodbye to my Bootstrap 4 baby from 2018. 

With TinaCMS integration, I'm also able to create blog posts much more frequently now. You'll see a variety of tech and personal finance blurbs based on whatever pops into my mind. You can subscribe to my blog here if interested.

I am still fairly new to Gatsby, so let me know if you come across anything on the site that can be improved!
